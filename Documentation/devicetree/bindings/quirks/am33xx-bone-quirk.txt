am33xx Beaglebone White/Black Device Tree Bindings
--------------------------------------------------

Beaglebone boards that boot with a common device tree blob contain
a DT quirk entry with the following properties:

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "ti,am33xx-bone-quirk"

Required child node:

- revs : Contains children nodes that identify boards

  Each child node of revs must be of the following form:

  Required properties:

  - board-id : Contain the board ID as it appears in the EEPROM
  - board-apply : Should contain the phandle of the quirk to apply

  Optional child node:

  - options : Contain a number of properties that identify options
  that can be enabled or disabled by external means. For Linux the
  options are selected by parsing the boot command line.
  The properties contain a tupple of quirk phandles, the first containing
  the enable quirk and the second the disable quirk. If the phandle is zero
  then no quirk is applied.

Any other nodes (like the quirk definitions are ignored).

The following example defines two revisions (white/black) with
board-id A335BONE for the white and A335BNLT for the black.
For the beaglebone black we also define two options
no-emmc and no-hdmi which when are present in the boot command line
the emmc and hdmi are disabled.

	beaglebone-quirks {
		compatible = "ti,am33xx-bone-quirk";
		status = "okay";

		revs {
			white {
				board-id = "A335BONE";
				board-apply = <&bonewhite>;
			};
			black {
				board-id = "A335BNLT";
				board-apply = <&boneblack>;
				options {
					no-emmc = <0 &black_enable_emmc>;
					no-hdmi = <0 &black_enable_hdmi>;
				};
			};
		};

		overlays {
			bonewhite: bonewhite {
				/* quirk for white */
				...
			};

			boneblack: boneblack {
				/* quirk for black */
				...
			};

			black_enable_hdmi: black_hdmi {
				/* quirk to enable hdmi */
				...
			};

			black_enable_emmc: black_emmc {
				/* quirk to enable emmc */
				...
			};
		};
	};
